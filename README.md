# About Portfolio

Deploted link:

An updated version of my previous portfolio. Just like the previous version, it is still based on HTML and CSS but, instead of Bootstrap, I used Materialize as CSS framework

## What Changes
1. Usage of Materialize instead of Boostrap CSS framework
2. Updated the portfolio page with actual projects
3. Added link to resume pdf, LinkedIn and Github repo
4. Tailored to be more mobile-responsive
