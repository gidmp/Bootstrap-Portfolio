                    <p>
                        Test test 1, 2, 3...Hi, My name is Daniel Luke Tanoeihusada. I am a Lab Assistant that manages
                        Histology quality control in
                        University of Washington Medical center, arguably one of the largest hospital in America.
                        On the side, I am a coding bootcamp student in University of Washington. I was born 
                        in Los Angeles and raised in America and sent back to the states in a quest that 
                        everyone is in for. Building a good life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My hobbies used to be playing video games and watching youtube 
                        at home; extremely enjoyable but also a very unproductive one. Realizing that it will not pay any dividend, I decided to get out 
                        of my comfort zone and try to learn coding, which I found surprisingly enjoyable. 
                        Sure, it is not the easiest thing to learn, but learning how to build a webpage
                        and solving tough puzzle-like problems are really fascinating. Then again, I am 
                        still a newbie when it comes to this, so please go easy on me :).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think being lost in life and having no sense of purpose is a very
                        frustrating and demoralizing feeling, oh and I know it very well. 
                        That is why, I believe, having a goal to walk towards to is 
                        very important and I am really grateful that I am enrolled in this coding bootcamp.
                        I hope that I have the strength to follow it through.
                    </p>
